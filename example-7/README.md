# Example 7

This example includes a header only implementation (ScopedPtr.h) with line 39 generating a PVS Studio warning:

```
example-7/ScopedPtr.h:7:1: warning: V690 Copy constructor is declared as private in the 'ScopedPtr' class, but the default '=' operator will still be generated by compiler. It is dangerous to use such a class.
```

## Ninja CMake Build Generator

Using Ninja as a backend there is a problem with implicit dependency detection resulting in not rescanning header only implementations:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -GNinja
ninja all
```
Now the above mentioned PVS warning is displayed as it should.

When uncommenting the line ScopedPtr.h:39 this warning should go away:
```
ninja all
```

This however does not happen because of: https://cmake.org/Bug/view.php?id=13234

Too bad CMake "fixed" the error implementing another parameter for ninja. So users have to implement different behaviour for different backends.
